# Final Project: Book Recommender System (BRS)
The book recommender system (BRS) includes a cosine-similarity-based search engine to look up books, a cosine-similarity-based collaborative filter to recommend books based on user ratings, a clustering-based exploratory data analysis (EDA) approach to explore the datasets used, a classification-based content filter to recommend books based on user descriptions, and a DialogFlow-and-Flask-based frontend. The Goodreads dataset used was scraped from Goodreads usersâ€™ public shelves (freely available on the web without login) by a group of researchers from University of California San Diego (UCSD) in 2017. The Wikipedia dataset used was extracted from Wikipedia articles on different books by a researcher from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). 

## Files

* app.py (Flask-based web application; fulfills DialogFlow requests)
* clustering.ipynb (clustering algorithm; generates insights for Goodreads dataset)
* collaborative_filtering.ipynb (collaborative filter; produces recommendations based on other users with similar likes)
* content_filter_classifiers.ipynb (content filter; multi-label classification using standard classifiers)
* content_filter_lstm_innovation.ipynb (content filter; multi-label classification using LSTM)
* dataset1_prep.ipynb (Goodreads dataset cleaning and preparation; saves book metadata table in a JSON object)
* dataset2_prep.ipynb (Wikipedia dataset cleaning and preparation; saves book metadata table in a CSV file)
* search.ipynb (search engine; yields book metadata)
